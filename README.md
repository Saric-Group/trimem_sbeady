# TriLMP = TriMEM + LAMMPS

**TriLMP** is a modified version of the [**TriMEM**](https://github.com/bio-phys/trimem) python package. It performs Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) simulations of lipid
membranes according to the Helfrich theory[^Helfrich1973]. Please refer to Siggel et al.[^Siggel2022] for details on the specific Hamiltonian simulated, or the [TriMEM documentation](https://trimem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) further information on the TriMEM package.

## Basic introduction
TriLMP couples TriMEM to [LAMMPS](https://github.com/lammps/lammps) via the python interface of the latter. Within TriLMP, the Dynamically Triangulated network (DTN) is a LAMMPS molecule made of particles (network vertices) that are connected through bonds (network edges). Throughout the simulation, TriLMP uses TriMEM to compute the Helfrich Hamiltonian as well as to obtain the list of vertices that have to be updated to ensure membrane fluidity. At each MD simulation step, TriMEM provides the force acting on each vertex in the network to LAMMPS so that vertices in the network move according to LAMMPS' time-integrators (e.g., velocity-Verlet). At a prescribed frequency (see TriLMP docs), TriLMP informs LAMMPS to update the network connectivity by removing and creating new bonds between particles in the molecule. Additionally, the calculation of the surface repulsion, which prevents the network from self-intersecting, is dealt with by LAMMPS instead of TriMEM in TriLMP. For further details on how to use the package, please refer to the HowTo_TriLMP.md file.

To run simulations with TriLMP, you will be creating an object of the class ```TriLmp```. While you can always edit the class in the trilmp.py file in `src/` for details), to run a basic simulation you will just have to
1. Pass to your ```TriLmp``` object the class attributes you want (e.g., membrane mechanical properties, size of the network, ...)
2. Call the ```TriLmp.run(params)``` method to actually run the simulation

## Installation guide

TriLMP has been successfully installed and tested in:
- Linux
- Mac OS (Sonoma)

We suggest installing TriLmp in a conda environment and then install trimem/trilmp as a editable install.
This allows you to alter trilmp functionality by directly tinkering with the src/trimem/trilmp.py file if needed.
This can come in handy in case you need to define or initialize a simulation set-up that is not covered by the current version of TriLMP.
The code is designed such that additional LAMMPS commands can always be passed as command strings once the ```trilmp``` object has been created.

### 1. Downloading the repository

Clone the repository by running:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules [repository]
git submodule update
```

### 2. Setting up the conda environment

To set up a conda environment including some prerequisites use:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Within the ```environment.yml``` file you can choose the name you want for your environment. Here we will call it ```Trienv```. Make sure that the environment is activated throughout the rest of the setup! For that, type

```
conda activate Trienv
```

### 3. Installing TriMEM/TriLMP
TriLMP can be installed using pip as follows: 

```
 pip install -e .
```

Build and compile the shared libraries using:
```bash
python setup.py build
```

Note that this folder will be the actual location of the modules with an editable install, i.e., if you change something in the python code here, effects will be immediate. In case you want to change something on the c++ side of the code, make sure to run "python3 setup.py build" in order to to compile and copy 
the libaries to the src/trimem folder as described below.

Finally some shared libraries have to be copied manually from the _skbuild folder. To do so, run

```
. copy_libs.sh
```

In Linux you may have to manually the copy the libraries by using:

```
cp _skbuild/linux-x86_64-3.11/cmake-build/core.cpython-311-x86_64-linux-gnu.so src/trimem/.
cp _skbuild/linux-x86_64-3.11/cmake-build/libtrimem.so src/trimem/.
cp _skbuild/linux-x86_64-3.11/cmake-build/Build/lib/* src/trimem/.
```


### 4. Installing LAMMPS

LAMMPS has to be installed using python shared libraries and some specific packages.
If you already have LAMMPS you might have to reinstall it. In any case you will have to 
perform the python install using your Trienv environment as we detail below.

Go back to the directory where you want to have your install folder and get lammps from git by running

```bash
git clone -b stable https://github.com/lammps/lammps.git lammps
```

We can now start installing LAMMPS. Go first to the ```lammps``` directory and create the ```build``` folder.
```bash
cd lammps                
mkdir build
cd build
```

Next we have to determine the python executable path. You can do that from the python console
using
```bash
python           
import sys
print(sys.executable)
```
which should print something like 

```bash
/nfs/scistore15/saricgrp/mmunozba/.conda/envs/Trienv/bin/python
```
and will be referred to as "python_path" in the next bash command. Note that this enables PyLammps in this specific conda environment only! 

Now we can set up the makefiles and build LAMMPS. The command line you see below is a suggestion for the LAMMPS packages you may want to compile for tests (these are suggested here because they have proved useful in the past in the development of works involving TriLMP).

```
cmake -D BUILD_OMP=yes -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=yes -D PYTHON_EXECUTABLE="/nfs/scistore15/saricgrp/mmunozba/.conda/envs/Trienv/bin/python" -D PKG_PYTHON=yes -D PKG_OPENMP=yes -D PKG_MOLECULE=yes  -D PKG_EXTRA-PAIR=yes -D PKG_EXTRA-FIX=yes -D PKG_EXTRA-COMPUTE=yes -D PKG_RIGID=yes -D PKG_ASPHERE=yes -D PKG_BROWNIAN=yes -D PKG_MC=yes -D PKG_REACTION=yes ../cmake 
cmake --build .
```

Roughly, this is what some of these packages can be useful for:
- ```EXTRA-PAIR``` $\rightarrow$ ```pair_style harmonic/cut```, ```pair_style cosine/squared```
- ```EXTRA-COMPUTE``` $\rightarrow$ ```compute gyration/shape```
- ```RIGID``` $\rightarrow$ ```fix rigid```
- ```ASPHERE``` $\rightarrow$ ```atom_style ellipsoid```
- ```MC``` $\rightarrow$ ```fix gcmc```, ```fix bond/create```
- ```REACTION``` $\rightarrow$ ```fix bond/react```

If you are missing specific packages or you want to extend your installation, you can always come back and recompile LAMMPS with additional packages.

For HPC clusters: If you try the above compilation and it is not working, try loading the openmpi module first by typing ```module load openmpi``` in the cluster.

Finally to make LAMMPS accessible for python, i.e. making and copying the shared libaries, use

```bash
make install-python
```

### Dependencies

This information has been copied from TriMEM's documentation. 

TriMEM builds upon the generic mesh data structure
[OpenMesh](https://www.graphics.rwth-aachen.de/software/openmesh/), which
is included as a submodule that is pulled in upon `git clone` via the
`--recurse-submodules` flag.

For the efficient utilization of shared-memory parallelism, TriMEM makes
use of the [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/) application programming model
(`>= v4.5`) and modern `C++`. It thus requires relatively up-to-date
compilers (supporting at least `C++17`).

If not already available, the following python dependencies will be
automatically installed:

* numpy
* scipy
* h5py
* meshio
* psutil

Documentation and tests further require:

* autograd
* trimesh
* sphinx
* sphinx-copybutton
* sphinxcontrib-programoutput
